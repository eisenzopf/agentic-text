## Setup

1. **Set up API keys** (choose one):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
   # OR
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
   ```

2. **Navigate to the processors directory**:
   ```bash
   cd examples/processors
   ```

## Usage Examples

### üéØ **Test Specific Processor**
Test a single processor with all sample conversations:
```bash
go run main.go -processor sentiment
go run main.go -processor data_analyzer
go run main.go -processor recommendation_engine
```

With verbose output for debugging:
```bash
go run main.go -processor sentiment -verbose
```

### üß™ **Test All Processors**
Run comprehensive testing across all processors:
```bash
go run main.go -test-all
```

Save results to file:
```bash
go run main.go -test-all -output results.json
```

### üéÆ **Interactive Mode**
Launch interactive mode for exploration:
```bash
go run main.go -interactive
```

Interactive commands:
```
processor-test> help                    # Show available commands
processor-test> list                    # List all processors
processor-test> conversations           # Show sample conversations
processor-test> test sentiment          # Test sentiment with all conversations
processor-test> test intent conv_001    # Test intent with specific conversation
processor-test> custom data_analyzer    # Test with custom text input
processor-test> quit                    # Exit
```

### ‚úèÔ∏è **Custom Text Input**
Test any processor with your own text:
```bash
go run main.go -interactive
# Then use: custom <processor_name>
# Enter your text and end with "###"
```

## Sample Conversations

The application includes 5 realistic customer service conversations:

1. **Fee Dispute** (`conv_001`) - Customer disputing late payment fee
2. **Technical Support** (`conv_002`) - Internet connectivity troubleshooting  
3. **Billing Inquiry** (`conv_003`) - Customer confused about bill increase
4. **Service Cancellation** (`conv_004`) - Customer relocating and cancelling service
5. **Product Inquiry** (`conv_005`) - Customer interested in upgrading internet speed

Each conversation includes:
- **Full dialogue** between customer and agent
- **Category classification** for organization
- **Summary description** for quick reference
- **Realistic scenarios** reflecting actual customer service interactions

## Processor-Specific Input Preparation

The application intelligently prepares input for different processors:

- **`required_attributes`** - Provides research questions about the conversation
- **`data_analyzer`** - Structures conversation data with analysis questions
- **`recommendation_engine`** - Includes conversation context and category
- **`quality_reviewer`** - Formats content for quality assessment
- **`attribute_matcher`** - Provides required and available attribute examples
- **`question_generator`** - Includes business context for question generation
- **Others** - Uses conversation text directly

## Output Format

All results are returned in structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "processor_name": "sentiment",
  "input": "conv_001",
  "duration": "1.234s",
  "output": {
    "sentiment": "positive", 
    "score": 0.8,
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "keywords": ["thank you", "appreciate", "great customer"],
    "processor_type": "sentiment"
  }
}
```

Error handling:
```json
{
  "processor_name": "sentiment",
  "input": "conv_001", 
  "duration": "0.123s",
  "error": "API rate limit exceeded"
}
```

## Use Cases

## Advanced Features

### **Batch Testing**
Test multiple processors efficiently:
```bash
go run main.go -test-all -verbose > detailed_results.log
```

### **Result Analysis**
Export and analyze results:
```bash
go run main.go -test-all -output results.json
# Then analyze results.json with your preferred tools
```

### **Custom Workflows**
Use interactive mode to build custom analysis workflows:
```
1. Generate research questions with question_generator
2. Identify required attributes with required_attributes  
3. Extract attributes with get_attributes
4. Analyze data with data_analyzer
5. Generate recommendations with recommendation_engine
6. Review quality with quality_reviewer
```

## Comparison with Python Examples

This Go implementation provides similar functionality to the Python contact center analysis examples:

| Python Feature | Go Implementation |
|----------------|------------------|
| `analyze_fee_disputes.py` | Comprehensive testing with `data_analyzer` and `recommendation_engine` |
| `generate_attributes.py` | `get_attributes` and `required_attributes` processors |
| `generate_intents.py` | `intent` and `categorizer` processors |
| Interactive analysis | Interactive mode with command-line interface |
| Batch processing | `-test-all` flag with multiple conversations |
| Error handling | Comprehensive error reporting and graceful failures |
